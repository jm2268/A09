		 <h4>Movie Reviews</h4>
		    <p>
			  "Lots of heat but not very much height. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the 
			  personalities of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened."
		    </p>
		    <p>
			 "I am watching this for the third time, trying to understand how this large group of capatalist pigs could royally screw their
			  families, descendants, nieghbors, their countrymen, and the restof the world with absolutley no compassion."
